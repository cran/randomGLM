Changes since 1.00

2022/04/08: 1.10-1

	. Added citations to DESCRIPTION and to help file for randomGLM

2021/06/12: 1.10

	. Bump version for release

2021/05/30: 1.09-992

	. Minor changes in internal code handling multi-threading (via cluster
	  functions from parallel) on Windows.

	. Cleanup of metadata (DESCRIPTION) and help files to comply with CRAN
	  rules

	. New argument 'weight' lets the user specify sample weights for the
	  underlying regression models.

	. DIFF: randomGLM now works with categorical data. Categorical variables are
	  first binarized, then used as other numeric variables except their
	  power in interactions can never be more than 1. This may lead to
	  slightly different predictions when some features are categorical.

	. New arguments  categoricalColumns  and maxCategoricalLevels allow
	  the user to specify which columns should be treated as categorical.

	. New argument includeSelfinteractions allows the user to turn off
	  self-interactions for continuous features. Older versions of
	  randomGLM allowed self-interactions but other statistical approaches
	  usually exclude them.

	. New argument replaceBadBagFeatures optionally turns on a more
	  efficient handling of features with missing data. The old behaviour
	  was to remove them from each bag without attempting to replace them;
	  the new, optional behaviour is to only sample from features that
	  have no missing values in the bag samples. This should lead to more
	  in-bag variables when missing data are present. 

	. Bug fix: randomGLM now correctly records variables that were
	  retained by the model selection when missing data are present. This
	  bug led to incorrect results from functions predict and
	  thinRandomGLM.

	. Function accuracyMeasures now also works with factors.

2013/05/22: 1.05-2

	. Bugfix: function works correctly with suvival objects.

	. Internal bugfix that may lead to slightly different sets of features
	  being selected for each bag.

2013/05/09: 1.05-1

	. More descriptive error message generated if all features are removed
	  from a bag due to missing data or constantness.

	. Bug fix: predictor now works with a test set that consists of a
	  single sample.

2013/02/18: 1.05

	. The predictor now works with a variety of responses including all
	  glm families and censored time (Surv) responses.

2013/02/06: 1.03

	. New function accuracyMeasures for convenient calculation of most
	  accuracy measures. 

2013/01/28: 1.02-1

	. Fixes to problems with feature names that are not valid R names.
	. Fixed a problem when using interactions with large numbers of
	  features. This required a switch from the gtools' function
	  combinations to an internal version; hence gtools is not required
	  anymore.

2013/01/23: 1.02

	. Coefficient names in returned models and in
	  featuresInForwardRegression are now easier to read for humans. New
	  argument interactionSeparatorForCoefNames lets the user specify how
	  interaction names are formed.

2013/01/20: 1.01

	. New argument minInBagObs lets user specify the minimum number of
	  unique in-bag observations for each bag. This prevents bags with too
	  few observations that can cause problems when fitting models.

	. Function now works even when there is a single OOB observation in
	  some bags

2013/01/15: 1.00-2

	. Fixed a failure of multi-threaded calculation with more than 100 bags.

2013/01/13: 1.00-1

	. Fixed a bug with default (NULL) nThreads.


Changes to version included in WGCNA

	. Parallelized main loop; number of threads can be controled via
	  argument nThreads

	. bagObsIndex element of output is now nObservationsPerBag times nBags
	  (transposed to what it was before)
